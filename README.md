<h3>Who I am? 👨‍💻</h3>
<p> I am a senior technician. I consider myself a "jack of all trades, master of some". For as long as I can remember, I have been passionate about technology, programming, wiring, Arduino, Raspberrys, robotics, 3D printing, drones, coffee and my passion for learning and thus my hobbies carry on growing, to the benefit of my brain and the detriment of my pocket...! </p>
